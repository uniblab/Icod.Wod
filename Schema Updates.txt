Run the mkXsd shell script against an Icod.Wod.dll build.
Copy both Xsd files over to the core Xsd files in the project directory.

Then perform some edits:
schema0.xsd:
change xs:import element: add attribute schemaLocation="./schema1.xsd"

schema1.xsd:
set minOccurs="1" for source of dbFileImport
set minOccurs="1" for destination of dbFileExport, binaryFileOperation, binaryZipOperation, sfRestSelect, sfBfulkSelect
set default="47.0" and use="optional" for the apdbFileExportiVersion attribute
set use="optional" to the apiVersion attribute of the BulkOperationBase

Rebuild project, and root Xsd's will be copied to the output directory.
