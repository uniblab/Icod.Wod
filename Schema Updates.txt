Run the mkXsd shell script against an Icod.Wod.dll build.
Copy both Xsd files over to the core Xsd files in the project directory.

Then perform some edits:
schema0.xsd:
change xs:import element: add attribute schemaLocation="./schema1.xsd"

schema1.xsd:
set minOccurs="1" for source of dbFileImport
set minOccurs="1" for destination of dbFileExport, binaryFileOperation, binaryZipOperation, sfRestSelect, sfBfulkSelect
set default="47.0" and use="optional" for the apiVersion attribute of both AggregateOperationBase and sfRestSelect
make sure the AggregateOperationBase has default schema actions of "Ignore", much like the FileExport

Rebuild project, and root Xsd's will be copied to the output directory.
