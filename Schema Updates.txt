Run the mkXsd shell script against an Icod.Wod.dll build.
Copy both Xsd files over to the core Xsd files in the project directory.

Then perform some edits:
schema0.xsd:
change xs:import element: add attribute schemaLocation="./schema1.xsd"

schema1.xsd:
set minOccurs="1" for source of dbFileImport
set minOccurs="1" for destination of dbFileExport, binaryFileOperation, binaryZipOperation, sfRestSelect
set default="47.0" and use="optional" for the apiVersion attribute of both AggregateOperationBase and sfRestSelect
make sure the AggregateOperationBase has default schema actions of "Ignore", much like the FileImport
make sure the AggregateMutationOperationBase has default missingSchemaAction of "Add" and missingMappingAction of "Passthrough", much like the dbFileExport

Rebuild project, and root Xsd's will be copied to the output directory.
