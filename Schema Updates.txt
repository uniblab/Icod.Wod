Run the mkXsd shell script against an Icod.Wod.dll build.
Copy both Xsd files over to the core Xsd files in the project directory.

Then perform some edits:
schema0.xsd:
add to the xs:import element the attribute=value schemaLocation="./schema1.xsd"

schema1.xsd:
set minOccurs="1" for source of fileImport
set minOccurs="1" for destination of binaryFileOperation, fileExport, binaryZipOperation, restSelect, bulkSelect
set default="47.0" and use="optional" for the apiVersion attribute

Rebuild project, and root Xsd's will be copied to the output directory.
